# Climate_Risk_Impacts_on_Sovereign_Bonds

The debt-to-GDP ratio has been recognized as an important factor for sovereign default risk, demonstrated through instrument values like bond yield and credit default spread. In a climate risk perspective, debt-to-GDP ratio will be impacted by the severity of environmental adversity and the effort from governments to mitigate the uncertainties. Under different climate change scenarios corresponding to respective global warming levels, economies will incur GDP loss from physical risk, debt increase from transition risk, or a combination effect of both.
We develop two models to incorporate climate risk in the simulation of debt-to-GDP ratio of 18 countries with different economic and geographical characteristics up to 2050, using penalties induced by climate change scenarios and other sustainability-related factors. The models use the debt-to-GDP outlook to evaluate the potential year of sovereign default for a scenario and the sovereign default probability for a specific year. The models enable cross-sectional analysis, which shows economic resilience of developed countries relative to emerging countries in the face of damage implied by climate risk.
